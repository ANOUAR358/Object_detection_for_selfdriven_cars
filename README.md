"Quick Project Description: Traffic Object DetectionOur project focuses on Traffic Object Detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) algorithm, designed to enhance the safety of vehicle navigation. By implementing real-time object detection, the system can accurately identify and classify various road entities, including pedestrians, vehicles, and traffic signs. This functionality significantly improves decision-making for autonomous vehicles, ensuring safer navigation and reducing the risk of accidents. The project leverages deep learning techniques to provide reliable and efficient object detection, crucial for advancing intelligent transportation systems."
